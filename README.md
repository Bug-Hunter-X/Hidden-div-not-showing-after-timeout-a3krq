This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in HTML related to hiding and showing elements using JavaScript. The bug arises from not properly handling potential issues when manipulating element visibility. The solution addresses the problem by ensuring that the element is present in the DOM before attempting to modify its display property.  This avoids potential runtime errors and ensures consistent behavior.
